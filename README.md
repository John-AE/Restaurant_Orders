### Database and Tables Creation
The project starts by creating a database named restaurant_db. Afterwards, two tables were created. A table named menu_items was created to store the menu items data. The table structure includes columns for menu_item_id, item_name, category and price. Another table called order_details was created to store the details of orders. It comprised five columns titled order_details_id, order_id, order_date, order_time and item_id.
